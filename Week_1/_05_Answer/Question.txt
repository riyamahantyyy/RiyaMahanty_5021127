Exercise 5: Task Management System
Scenario: 
You are developing a task management system where tasks need to be added, deleted, and traversed efficiently.
Steps:

1.Understand Linked Lists:
	Explain the different types of linked lists (Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List).

2.Setup:
	Create a class Task with attributes like taskId, taskName, and status.

3.Implementation:
	Implement a singly linked list to manage tasks.
	Implement methods to add, search, traverse, and delete tasks in the linked list.

4.Analysis:
	Analyze the time complexity of each operation.
	Discuss the advantages of linked lists over arrays for dynamic data.
