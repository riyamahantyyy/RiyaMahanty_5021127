Exercise 6: Library Management System
Scenario: 
You are developing a library management system where users can search for books by title or author.
Steps:

1.Understand Search Algorithms:
	Explain linear search and binary search algorithms.

2.Setup:
	Create a class Book with attributes like bookId, title, and author.

3.Implementation:
	Implement linear search to find books by title.
	Implement binary search to find books by title (assuming the list is sorted).

4.Analysis:
	Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search.
	Discuss when to use each algorithm based on the data set size and order.
