Exercise 7: Financial Forecasting
Scenario: 
You are developing a financial forecasting tool that predicts future values based on past data.
Steps:

1.Understand Recursive Algorithms:
	Explain the concept of recursion and how it can simplify certain problems.

2.Setup:
	Create a method to calculate the future value using a recursive approach.

3.Implementation:
	Implement a recursive algorithm to predict future values based on past growth rates.

4.Analysis:
	Discuss the time complexity of your recursive algorithm.
	Explain how to optimize the recursive solution to avoid excessive computation.
