Exercise 7: Implementing Constructor and Setter Injection
Scenario: 
The library management application requires both constructor and setter injection for better control over bean initialization.
Steps:
1.	Configure Constructor Injection:
o	Update applicationContext.xml to configure constructor injection for BookService.
2.	Configure Setter Injection:
o	Ensure that the BookService class has a setter method for BookRepository and configure it in applicationContext.xml.
3.	Test the Injection:
o	Run the LibraryManagementApplication main class to verify both constructor and setter injection.
