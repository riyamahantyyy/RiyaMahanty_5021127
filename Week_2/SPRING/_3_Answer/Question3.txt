Exercise 3: Implementing Logging with Spring AOP
Scenario: 
The library management application requires logging capabilities to track method execution times.
Steps:
1.	Add Spring AOP Dependency:
o	Update pom.xml to include Spring AOP dependency.
2.	Create an Aspect for Logging:
o	Create a package com.library.aspect and add a class LoggingAspect with a method to log execution times.
3.	Enable AspectJ Support:
o	Update applicationContext.xml to enable AspectJ support and register the aspect.
4.	Test the Aspect:
o	Run the LibraryManagementApplication main class and observe the console for log messages indicating method execution times.
